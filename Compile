Step 1: Make sure you have flask installed:
- flask: pip install flask
- python

Step 2: Initialize the database file:
- In the terminal, type 'python init_db.py'
- If you look in the project directory, a new file called database.db should have been created
- If you make any changes to schema.sql, you will need to run 'python init_db.py' again.
- If you close VS code and relaunch the program, you do not need to run 'python init_db.py' again. The database stays consistent.

Step 3: Run the app.py file.
- In the terminal, type 'python app.py'.
- You should see a "Running on..." message pop up; follow this URL to access the webpage.
